# Regression Project ✨💊
- Dataset of this project is fetched from Kaggle, here is url : https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/lish-moa

## Dataset Info💊
As a shorthand to describe the biological activity of a given molecule, scientists assign a label referred to as mechanism-of-action or MoA for short.
Unique dataset that combines gene expression and cell viability data. In addition, I will have access to MoA annotations for more than 5,000 drugs in this dataset.
Target feature is MoA labels. I take into account this project as regression task and done algorithms based on this point of view.
